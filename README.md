# ðŸš€ React Project Setup & Workflow

This is a React-based web application cloned from a Git repository. The goal is to set it up locally, make changes on your own branch, and contribute efficiently.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/MariaGpeSotoAcosta/ChivasTV.git
  cd your-repo-name

  ```

### 2. Install Dependencies
  
    npm install
    
### 3. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
## Making changes
### 1. Create and push a branch
### Make sure youâ€™re on the latest version of main:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```
### 2. Create a new branch with your own name NOT your-branch-name
```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name 
```

### 3. Make your changes (e.g., update App.jsx):
```jsx
<h1>Welcome to ChivasTV â€“ Updated by YOURNAME ðŸš€</h1>
```
### 4. Stage, commit, and push:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update App header from YOURNAME's branch"
git push origin your-branch-name
```
